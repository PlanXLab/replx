"""bluetooth - low-level BLE interface.

This module provides direct access to the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack.
It supports both peripheral (GATT server) and central (GATT client) roles.

Notes
-----
- Availability, feature set, and tuple formats can vary by port and firmware
    build options.
- IRQ callbacks run in a constrained context; keep handlers short and avoid
    allocating large objects. If you need to do substantial work, defer it to
    the scheduler or an `uasyncio` task.
- Many operations are asynchronous: results are delivered via the IRQ handler.

Example
-------
```python
    >>> import bluetooth
    >>> 
    >>> ble = bluetooth.BLE()
    >>> ble.active(True)
    >>> 
    >>> ble.gap_advertise(100_000, b'\\x02\\x01\\x06')
```
