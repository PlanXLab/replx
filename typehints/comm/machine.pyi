"""
Hardware control module for MicroPython.

Provides access to hardware-specific functions for GPIO, PWM, I2C, SPI,
UART, ADC, Timer, RTC, and other peripheral interfaces.

Example
-------
```python
    >>> from machine import Pin, PWM, I2C
    >>> 
    >>> # GPIO control
    >>> led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)
    >>> led.toggle()
    >>> 
    >>> # PWM output
    >>> pwm = PWM(Pin(15))
    >>> pwm.freq(1000)
    >>> pwm.duty_u16(32768)
    >>> 
    >>> # I2C communication
    >>> i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(1), sda=Pin(0), freq=400000)
    >>> devices = i2c.scan()
```

def freq(hz: Optional[int] = None) -> int:
    """
    Get or set the CPU frequency.

    This controls the CPU (and sometimes system) clock rate. Changing the CPU
    frequency can trade performance vs power consumption and may affect timing-
    sensitive code.

    Support and valid frequency values are port/board specific. On ports that
    support changing frequency, passing a value attempts to reconfigure the CPU
    clock. On ports that don't support changing frequency, providing ``hz`` may
    raise an exception.

    :param hz: New frequency in Hz (if setting). Use ``None`` to query only.

    :returns: Current CPU frequency in Hz.

    :raises ValueError: If the requested frequency is invalid (port-specific).
    :raises OSError: If the frequency cannot be set on this port/board.

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import freq
        >>> 
        >>> print(freq())        # Get current frequency

def unique_id() -> bytes:
    """
    Get the unique identifier of the board.

    The returned value is a board- or MCU-specific identifier. It is commonly
    used to derive a per-device name, a network identifier, or to seed a PRNG.
    The exact length and stability guarantees are port dependent.

    :returns: Unique ID as bytes (often 6 or 8 bytes, but port-specific).

    Example
    -------
    ```python

def reset() -> None:
    """
    Reset the device.

    This performs a full system reset (similar to pressing the reset button).
    After calling this function the board restarts and the current program
    does not continue.

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import reset

    A soft reset restarts the MicroPython runtime (VM) without necessarily
    performing the same kind of full hardware reset as ``reset()``. The exact
    effect on peripherals and hardware state is port/board specific.

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import soft_reset
        >>> 
        >>> soft_reset()

    ``PWRON_RESET`` or ``WDT_RESET``. Availability and meaning of constants
    is port dependent.

    :returns: Reset cause constant

    Example
    -------

    Enter the bootloader (UF2 mode on RP2).

    This is typically used to put the board into a firmware update mode.
    Behavior varies by port/board. On some ports the optional ``size``
    argument is used to control the USB MSC/UF2 presentation.

    :param size: Optional size parameter

    Example
    -------

def idle() -> None:
    """
    Wait for an interrupt, reducing power consumption.

    This function hints to the CPU that it can sleep until the next interrupt.
    It is commonly used in polling loops to reduce power consumption.

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import idle
        >>> 
        >>> while True:
        ...     idle()  # Low-power wait

    """

def lightsleep(time_ms: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    """
    Enter light sleep mode.

    Light sleep is a low-power state where the CPU stops or slows down, but the
    system can usually resume without a full reset. Wake sources and what state
    is retained are port/board specific.

    :param time_ms: Sleep duration in milliseconds (None = indefinite)

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import lightsleep
        >>> 
        >>> lightsleep(5000)  # Sleep for 5 seconds
    ```
    """
    ...


def deepsleep(time_ms: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    """
    Enter deep sleep mode.

    Deep sleep is a lower-power state than ``lightsleep()``. On many ports the
    device will reset on wake-up (i.e. the program restarts from boot). What
    memory/state is retained depends on the port and hardware.

    :param time_ms: Sleep duration in milliseconds (None = indefinite)

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import deepsleep

def disable_irq() -> int:
    """
    Disable interrupt requests.

    Returns a value representing the previous IRQ state. Pass this value back
    to ``enable_irq()`` to restore the prior state.

    This is useful for short critical sections. Keep the protected code small:
    disabling interrupts for too long can break time-sensitive peripherals.

    :returns: Previous IRQ state (pass to enable_irq)

    Example
    -------
    ```python
        >>> from machine import disable_irq, enable_irq
