"""vfs - virtual filesystem helpers.

This module provides filesystem driver classes and a small mounting API.
Most ports expose the same operations through the `os` module (e.g.
`os.mount`, `os.umount`, `os.VfsFat`, `os.VfsLfs2`). Some ports also keep a
separate `vfs` module for compatibility.

Notes
-----
- The concrete block device API is port-specific, but typically provides
    `readblocks`, `writeblocks`, and `ioctl`.
- `mkfs()` formats the underlying block device and will destroy existing data.
- Paths are interpreted by the VFS layer once mounted; relative paths are
    resolved against the current directory (`os.getcwd()` / `Vfs*.getcwd()`).

        >>> import vfs

        >>> # Create and mount a filesystem object at a mount point.
        >>> fs = vfs.VfsFat(bdev)
